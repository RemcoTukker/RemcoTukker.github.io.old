# Experiments

Without experiments, one would never realize in what a wonderful world we live and how limited our perception of this universe actually is. Here are some links to websites that have a collection of experiments that can be tried at home :-)

The True Inventors:

* [Robert Murray Smith](https://www.youtube.com/user/RobertMurraySmith) Chemist that has a lot of videos showing you precisely how to make photoactive materials, graphene, batteries, etc.
* [Nyle Steiner](http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/) Mainly electronics related experiments, such as homemade tunnel diodes, memristors and lots of other components. Also has links to more science projects websites at the bottom of his website.

* [Laserhacker](http://laserhacker.com) Interesting electronics stuff.

Neuroscience Stuff:
