# This Website

This website is simply my braindump: the place where I organize my thoughts and projects both for myself and the rest of the world. In case you would like to discuss one of the topics I have an opinion on, or just simply want to report a broken link, etc, feel free to contact me (see [About Me](../AboutMe/) for contact details).

### Technology

#### Functionality
* Content is presented as a one-page site for people that have a modern browser, while the pages can also be found individually for search engines (SEO) or people without JavaScript
* Content in Jade and Markdown for convenience, converted to HTML by Grunt
* Git repo and hosting
* Grunt tasks also include a Connect server for local testing
* Fancy graph-based navigation based on VisJS; graph data is automatically generated by a server-side mini-crawler

#### Code
The javascript and css of this website is open source, licensed with an [Apache v2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/RemcoTukker/RemcoTukker.github.io); feel free to fork! Just don't forget that the actual content (markdown files) is under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

#### Todo

* Automatically generate the index page that is used by non-JavaScript users
* See how to fix visjs issues / open issues (in order of importance: resizing, missing nodes, arrows/lines mismatch with ellipse shape nodes)
* Custom 404
* Loading and unloading Javascript and CSS on different pages dynamically
* Using [Markdown Resume Builder](http://there4development.com/markdown-resume/) to present my resume in a prettier way (or [JSON resume](http://jsonresume.org) which I ran into today)
* Improving code: documentation, functionality of mini-crawler (make it a proper crawler!)
* Just search for TODO in the codebase and you'll find the rest!

### Acknowledgements

This website wouldn't be possible without:
* Hosting generously provided by [Github](http://www.github.com)
* The graph visualization [visjs](http://visjs.org) build by my old colleagues at Almende
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org) and a workflow inspired by [Roman Nesterov](http://rhrn.github.io/)
* And of course, the obiqitous [JQuery](http://jquery.com) for the frontend, and the Jquery inspired [Cheerio](http://cheeriojs.github.io/cheerio/) for the mini-crawler at the backend
