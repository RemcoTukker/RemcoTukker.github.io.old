# SVG Pan Zoom Code

This is a demo of my JS PanZoom code for autoscaled SVGs. See [the github repo](https://github.com/RemcoTukker/SVGPanZoom) for the code and an explanation of how to use it yourself. I made it for the panning and zooming of the navigation menu of this site.

Reminder to self: write up a walkthrough of this code next time I look at it.
