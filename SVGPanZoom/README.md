# SVG Pan Zoom Code

This is a demo of my JS PanZoom code for autoscaled SVGs. See [the github repo](https://github.com/RemcoTukker/SVGPanZoom) for the code and an explanation of how to use it yourself. I made it for the panning and zooming of the navigation menu of this site.

### Features

* Simple and short code, very easy to use
* Some simple configuration options (eg zoom speed)
* Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, IE11, Firefox, mobile browsers as well)
* Supports mouse and touch events, including pinch to zoom
* Works with autoscaled SVGs, even when size of SVG is changing
* No dependencies
* Code can be embedded in SVG or loaded elsewhere in the DOM
* JS module, (TODO) including support for RequireJS

Reminder to self: write up a walkthrough of this code next time I look at it.
