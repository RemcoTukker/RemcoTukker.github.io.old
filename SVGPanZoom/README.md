# SVG Pan Zoom Code

SVG Pan Zoom code including support for autoscaled SVGs and touch events. Supported browsers: IE9+ FF Chrome Android 4+. Can be embedded in SVG image or anywhere else in the page. Only required effort is that you match the ID tag of the svg element and the panzoom element with the IDs that the code is looking for. The panzoom element should be a ``<g transform="matrix(a,b,c,d,e,f)">`` with numbers substituted for the letters of course.

Separate Github repo will be made as soon as I take the time to find out how I could link to that code in this page.
